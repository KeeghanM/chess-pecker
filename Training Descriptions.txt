                  Train tactics using the WoodPecker Method developed by GM's
                  Axel Smith, and Hans Tikkanen.

                <p>
                  The quick explanation of the Woodpecker Method is that you
                  need to solve a large number of puzzles in a row; then solve
                  the same puzzles again and again, only faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s not a lazy shortcut to success – hard work is required.

                  But the reward can be re-programming your unconscious mind.
                  Benefits include sharper tactical vision, fewer blunders,
                  better play when in time trouble and improved intuition.

                  Do you struggle to see past two or three moves? Find long
                  calculations difficult? So did we.

                  With our visualisation trainer you are presented with a board
                  position, and a list of moves at the end of which will be a
                  simple tactic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All you need to do is play the given sequence of moves in your
                  head, decide on your final move and then check if you were
                  correct.

                  Beginners often struggle with Knights, as their movement can
                  be complicated
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have devised a very simple method of quickly improving your
                  ability to see knight moves, routes, and tactics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  SImply put, you have to calculate the fastest way a knight can
                  get to a given square. The difficulty can ramp up with other
                  pieces involved.
